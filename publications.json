    "summary": "TL;DR: We propose a method to generate visual metaphors from linguistic metaphors using a collaboration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models. We use Instruct GPT-3 with Chain-of-Thought prompting to generate text that represents a visual elaboration of the linguistic metaphor, containing the implicit meaning and relevant objects, which is then used as input to the diffusion-based text-to-image models. We end up creating 6,476 visual metaphors and associated visual elaborations."
