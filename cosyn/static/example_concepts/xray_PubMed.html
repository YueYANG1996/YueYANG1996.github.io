While many medical organizations employ CT scans as well, the radiation dose and the sanitization process set an obstacle to efficient diagnosis [47].

Due to these advantages, Chest X-rays are used as the primary COVID-19 investigation modality in the United Kingdom (UK) [48].

            "doc_content": "ID: 3311_20651, \n Primary pulmonary lymphoma (PPL) refers to lymphomas occurring primarily from the lungs representing 0.4% of all lymphomas, 3\u20134% of extranodal lymphoma, and only 0.5%-1% of primary pulmonary neoplasms (1, 2). PPL is defined as a malignant clonal proliferation of lymphatic tissue in the lung, which must be differentiated from the metastasis to lung of lymphoma from other sites, such as stomach. In 1993, Cordier developed the following diagnostic criteria for PPL (3) (1) definite pathological evidence showing pulmonary lymphoma (2) chest X-ray showing the lesions in the unilateral or bilateral lungs without evidence of mediastinal adenopathy or mass, or computed tomography (CT) scan showing predominant pulmonary involvement with mediastinal adenopathy (3) no extrathoracic lymphoma previously diagnosed (4) no extrathoracic lymphoma or lymphatic leukemia detected at diagnosis (5) no detectable extrathoracic involvement at diagnosis or in the next 3 months. \n\n",

This study describes a 51-year-old male smoker patient admitted with diabetes mellitus. An abdominal ultrasonography performed due to his anemia revealed bilateral adrenal masses. His chest X-ray showed abnormal 10\u2009cm opacity at the right upper lung, and brain, thorax, and abdomen CT scans showed multiple lesions compatible with lung cancer metastases. The pathological examination of the transthoracic lung biopsy specimen was consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Findings in this patient indicate that, in middle aged patients with bilateral adrenal mass and a history or finding of any malignancy, the first diagnosis which should be considered is adrenal metastasis, and confirming the diagnosis by adrenal biopsy may be useless. Furthermore, screening all smoking patients by chest X-ray or thoracic CT for lung cancer may not be accepted as a routine procedure, but in smokers admitted to a hospital due to signs and symptoms attributed to a pulmonary disease, at least a chest X-ray should be requested. \n\n",

Missing the diagnosis is extremely dangerous for fear of the development of tension pneumothorax especially if the patient is placed on a mechanical ventilator. The second case is not a true occult pneumothorax and is better nominated as a missed pneumothorax where the X-ray report did not confirm the presence of pneumothorax when there were 2 clues for the diagnosis. The presence of an apical pleural stripe and a clearly visible cardiophrenic sulcus should have drawn attention to the diagnosis. We therefore suggest that the X-ray should be interpreted by a well trained radiologist and also by the treating physician who, in the setting of a trauma patient, will have a higher index of suspicion for the diagnosis. The third case demonstrated the predictability of occult pneumothorax. \n\n",
