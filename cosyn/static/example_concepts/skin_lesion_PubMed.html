The mucosal localizations, such as in the oral cavity, oesophagus, larynx, the ano-genital mucosa, and in ovarian cystic teratoma have been also described. Primary MM of the lung is an uncommon neoplasm that may be confused with more conventional types of lung cancer. The proposed criteria for diagnosis are often difficult to be fulfilled, and the lesion is characterised by a poor prognosis.

When patients present with one or more AMLs, excision for histopathological diagnosis may be necessary, but more advanced non-invasive diagnostic methods might be preferred.

This technique allows for visualization of diagnostic features of skin lesions not visible to the naked eye.

Dermoscopy is performed with a hand microscope called a dermatoscope, which allows us to see under the skin surface in detail using polarized light. Thanks to the ABCD criteria used in the dermoscopy method, superior performance is obtained than other imaging methods [6]. However, precise and rapid skin lesion segmentation remains challenging due to diversity of skin lesions and the low difference between normal and lesioned skin. In addition, many artifacts such as hair strands and blood vessels cause problems during the segmentation [7\u201319]. For this reason, automated medical image segmentation is essential for facilitating the lesion's pathological diagnosis, planning treatment, and monitoring the disease's progress [20]. \n\n",

LM is often described as a \u201cbenign\u201d lesion and is accepted as a melanoma in situ; LM can undergo malignant transformation to particularly aggressive melanoma. LMM is an invasive melanoma that shares properties of LM, as well as exhibiting the metastatic potential of malignant melanoma. Unfortunately, LM/LMM diagnosis based on dermoscopy is rather ambiguous, and these lesions are often mistaken for junctional dysplastic nevi over sun-damaged skin, pigmented actinic keratosis, solar lentigo, or seborrheic keratosis. Diagnosis must be made on biopsy using distinct dermatopathologic features. These include a pagetoid appearance of melanocytes, melanocyte atypia, non-uniform pigmentation/distribution of melanocytes, and increased melanocyte density in a background of extensive photodamage. \n\n",

Recently, studies testing the usefulness of combining RCM with digital dermoscopy monitoring have shown a reduction in the number of lesions excised to diagnose skin cancer, reflecting a 2-fold reduction in unnecessary biopsies [4]. Most of the studies available in the literature discuss the accuracy of RCM in making a diagnosis that corresponds to the histology and/or compare the criteria observed in dermoscopy and/or histology with those observed under RCM examination. However, few studies directly compare the differentiation accuracy between melanocytic and non-melanocytic lesions, the majority focusing on facial lesions [5].

In agreement with the evaluation of pigmented lesions elsewhere on the skin, a multi-step diagnostic procedure has proven to be successful [2]. A first step is dedicated to the differentiation of a melanocytic origin (longitudinal melanonychia) from a non-melanocytic origin of the nail pigmentation (non-continuous discoloration).

The first step was introduced to simplify dermatoscopy and to exclude non-melanocytic lesions from further analysis by short algorithms like the ABCD rule, the 7-point checklist, Menzies rule, or the CASH algorithm. The reason for introducing the first step probably was that many non-melanocytic lesions, especially seborrheic keratoses, would have been wrongly classified as melanomas.

Physical examination revealed a single hyperpigmented oval macule of 5 mm with a rough surface. The color of the lesion was dark brown to light brown. Dermoscopic examination demonstrated atypical pigment network with small dotted vessels. Irregular streaks were also partially noted at the periphery. We suspected superficial spreading melanoma and performed an excision. The histologic features were consistent with a diagnosis of pigmented Bowen's disease. We could not completely account for dermoscopic aspects from the pathological findings of hematoxylin and eosin-stained specimens; therefore, specimens were stained with Fontana-Masson stain. It clearly demonstrated the distribution of melanin in the epidermis. We concluded that atypical network was due to an uneven melanin deposition in the variably thickened epidermal rete ridges. \n\n",

In order to diagnose the medical problems of melanoma lesions, dermatologists directly examine the damaged skin's uniformity, inconsistencies in the borders, and color changes [4]. Moreover, dermoscopy, a nontrauma skin imaging technique, is also very popular to assist dermatologists to examine the affected skin. The accuracy for identification of melanoma lesions through dermoscopy is higher than the traditional method of ABCD rule criteria [7]. This ABCD rule is designed by the American Society for skin lesions [8]. Nevertheless, the biopsy test is the only thing on which the performance is solely dependent. In the initial stages, the identification of melanoma greatly matters since in the initial stages the possibility of recovery is much higher than in the later stages. \n\n",

It is found that, by using dermoscopy techniques, the sensitivity of finding the lesion area increases up to 20% [5]. Dermoscopy images give dermatologists confidence in determining the lesion.
